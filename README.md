# Tensorflow Object Detection  
The Tensorflow 2 Object Detection API makes it possible for us to access state-of-the-art Object Detection models such as YOLO, SSD etc.  <br>

## Template for training a custom Object Detection on Colab:  
This is my template for creating custom classes for TFOD in Google Colab.  <br>

## Custom class recognition
This is an attempt at recognizing guitars with a custom trained model.  <br>

## Video Object Detection
Since videos are a set of moving images we can implement object detection on them by looping through images.  <br>
