# Tensorflow Object Detection
The Tensorflow 2 Object Detection API makes it possible for us to access state-of-the-art Object Detection models such as YOLO, SSD etc.

This repo is my attempt at some Object detection following the excellently written TFOD tutorial: 
https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

1. Template for training a custom Object Detection on Colab
- This is my template for creating custom classes for TFOD in Google Colab.

3. Custom class recognition
- This is an attempt at recognizing guitars with a custom trained model.

3. Video Object Detection
- Since videos are a set of moving images we can implement object detection on them by looping through images.
